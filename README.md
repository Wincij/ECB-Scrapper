# ECB-Scrapper
REST API European Central Bank currencies scrapper. Build with Django 2.1.2, BeautifulSoup4 (as a scrapper) and Requests.


All requirements are in requirements.txt file.

First we use Reuquests module to get every currency RSS from https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/rss.en.html. Site is set as static parameter - can be changed in future.
It will be useful to get real time data scrap from ECB site every time the page is loaded. If for example, some currencies will change in near future. 
We use BeautifulSoup4 to get all content of every RSS channel (every currency is indeed explicit):

- https://www.ecb.europa.eu/rss/fxref-usd.html

- https://www.ecb.europa.eu/rss/fxref-jpy.html

- https://www.ecb.europa.eu/rss/fxref-bgn.html

- https://www.ecb.europa.eu/rss/fxref-czk.html

- https://www.ecb.europa.eu/rss/fxref-dkk.html

and so on...


For each link before the site is rendered getRate() function reads content from RSS and scrap it to get only currency rate info. It returns string like:

- 1.1275 USD = 1 EUR 2019-03-12 ECB Reference rate

- 7.4602 DKK = 1 EUR 2019-03-12 ECB Reference rate

- 15.6466 EEK = 1 EUR 2010-12-31 ECB Reference rate

 so its still a bit too much text...


In the end the site is generated by context to compose the results.
It's necessary to split each string and to make an easy context dictionary for our html template. All that happens moment before rendering - in the Django "views".
